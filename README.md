Welcome to Text Adventure :)

This is a game created for the purpose of the competition called Get Noticed! 2017.
Feel free to download every file that is uploaded by me.

Working with files:

After downloading the repository you can either open the 'Builds' folder in every mini-game or (if you have Unity installed)
use the rest of the files in your projects, you can also change them as you wish.
